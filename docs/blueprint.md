- Background color: A very light gray (#F0F4F8), almost white, creating a clean and modern feel, especially suited to the large amount of content anticipated in this app.
- Accent color: A subdued lime green (#A5D6A7) suggesting growth and new opportunities. For a muted look, the colors are deliberately lower in saturation and brightness than pure, vibrant shades.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) provides a modern, neutral, and readable look.
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' (monospace) for any code snippets or technical displays.
- Use minimalist, outline-style icons that are easily understandable.
- Use subtle transitions and animations to guide the user through the strategic planning process and highlight AI suggestions.
